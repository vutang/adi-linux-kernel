  adi,clkout-mode:
    description: |
      Controls in which mode the CLKOUT PIN should work:
        0 - Configures the CLKOUT pin to output the internal system clock
        1 - Configures the CLKOUT pin to output the internal conversion time
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [0, 1]

  adi,rsense-nano-ohms:
    description: Value of the sense resistor.

  adi,vin-mode-microvolt:
    description:
      Selects operating range for the the Undervoltage, Overvoltage and Foldback
      pins. Also for the ADC. Should be set to the nominal input voltage.
    enum: [3300000, 5000000, 12000000, 24000000]
    default: 12000000

  adi,fet-bad-timeout-ms:
    description:
      From the moment a FET bad conditions is present, this property selects the
      wait time/timeout for a FET-bad fault to be signaled. Setting this to 0,
      disables FET bad faults to be reported.
    default: 255
    maximum: 255

  adi,overvoltage-dividers:
    description: |
      Select which dividers to use for VDD Overvoltage detection. Note that
      when the internal dividers are used the threshold is referenced to VDD.
      The percentages in the datasheet are misleading since the actual values
      to look for are in the "Absolute Maximum Ratings" table in the
      "Comparator Inputs" section. In there there's a line for each of the 5%,
      10% and 15% settings with the actual min, typical and max tolerances.
        0 - Use the external dividers.
        1 - Internal dividers 5%
        2 - Internal dividers 10%
        3 - Internal dividers 15%

  adi,current-limit-microvolt:
    description:
      The current limit sense voltage of the LTC4282 is adjustable between
      12.5mV and 34.4mV in 3.1mV steps. This effectively limits the current
      on the load.

      Overcurrent fault.
    type: boolean

  adi,overvoltage-retry-disable:
    description:
      If set, disables the part to auto-retry 50ms after an Overvoltage fault.
      It's enabled by default.
    type: boolean

  adi,undervoltage-retry-disable:
    description:
      If set, disables the part to auto-retry 50ms after an Undervoltage fault.
      It's enabled by default.
    type: boolean

    type: boolean

  adi,gpio1-mode:
    description: |
      Defines the function of the Pin.
          0 - GPIO Mode.
          1 - Power Bad. Goes into high-z to indicate that the output power is
              no longer good.
          2 - Power Good. Pulls low to indicate that the output power is no
              longer good.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    maximum: 2

  adi,gpio2-mode:
    description: |
      Defines the function of the Pin.
          0 - GPIO Mode.
